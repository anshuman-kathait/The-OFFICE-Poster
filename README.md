I was looking at stuff for my room, and being a fan of THE OFFICE, I wanted this poster I saw on ETSY, which was 40$.

Since 40$ is too much in INR (3420rs to be exact) , and a poster can be printed at a fraction of the price(40rs), and to frame the poster would cost an additional 300rs. I could have saved a lot of money if I had the original image of the poster. So I scoured the internet. Spent a good amount of time before I decided to just do it myself. 

to get the image, just save both index.html and style.css into a the same folder, and then run index.html to get the best resolution of the poster available. A sample image is attached for reference
